# Zeus Fix – Technician Landing Page & Brand Identity

**Live site**: [https://zeusfix.me](https://zeusfix.me)

A responsive one-page website built for a self-employed technician specializing in low-voltage electrical systems — including camera installation and maintenance services.  
This website acts as a live business card and main contact hub for clients.

In addition to development, I also designed the **brand identity** — including the logo, color scheme, visual assets, and print materials.

## 🎨 Branding & Design

Although this is a small-scale local business, I treated the branding with full professional care:

- **Logo design** – clean, technical, and minimal
- **Visual language** – fonts, colors, icon style
- **Business cards** – matching print design for in-person interactions
- **Installation stickers** – small branded labels placed next to installed cameras, according to technical standards
- **Website UI** – responsive, accessible, and brand-consistent

All design and development were done by me.
