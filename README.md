# Zeus Fix – Technician Landing Page & Brand Identity

![Zeus Fix – site mockup](zeus.jpg)

**Live site**: [https://zeusfix.me](https://zeusfix.me)

A responsive one-page website built for an independent low-voltage technician, specializing in electrical systems such as camera installation and maintenance.  
The site functions as a digital business card, providing clients with a clear overview of services and direct contact options.

In addition to development, I also designed the **brand identity** — including the logo, color scheme, visual assets, and print materials.

## 🎨 Branding & Design

Although this is a small-scale local business, I treated the branding with full professional care:

- **Logo design** – clean, technical, and minimal
- **Visual language** – fonts, colors, icon style
- **Business cards** – matching print design for in-person interactions
- **Installation stickers** – small branded labels placed next to installed cameras, according to technical standards
- **Website UI** – responsive, accessible, and brand-consistent

All design and development were done by me.
